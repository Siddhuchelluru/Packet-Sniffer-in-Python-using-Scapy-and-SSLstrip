# Packet-Sniffer-in-Python-using-Scapy-and-SSLstrip
This is a Python script that captures and analyzes network packets using the Scapy library. The script allows you to specify a network interface to sniff on, apply a BPF filter to customize which packets are captured, and write the captured packets to a PCAP file if desired.
